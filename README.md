# Code-from-Bell-et-al-2021
This repository contains the code used for data analysis in Bell et al 2021 Nature Communications.

It is not intended as a ready to use package for other data sets.

The analysis code made use of Matlab's image processing and optimization toolboxes as well as approximate nearest neighbor finding functions created by Sunil Arya, Dahua Lin, and David Mount.
